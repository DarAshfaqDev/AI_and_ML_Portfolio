// NOTE ON CONTACT DETAILS:
// The reference repo's README lists dar1.ishfaq36@gmail.com as the contact email.
// Its contact.html page, however, lists a different name's email/phone
// (likely leftover template data that was never replaced). That mismatched
// info was deliberately NOT carried over here. Replace PHONE below with your
// real number, and double-check EMAIL before deploying.
