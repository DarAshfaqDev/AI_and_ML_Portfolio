    description:
      "A Master's-level CBMIR system that retrieves visually similar medical images using a Vision Transformer (ViT) for deep feature extraction and FAISS for efficient similarity search. Includes Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide visual insights into which regions of the input image contribute most to retrieval, improving transparency and interpretability for clinical applications.",
